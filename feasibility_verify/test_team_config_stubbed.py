"""CPU-only test for the team layout JSON.

No Isaac, no GPU: this is pure parsing and validation. It is worth its own suite
because every field here fails *late* if it is wrong -- a bad model name surfaces
as a missing YAML halfway through scene load, and a bad room name surfaces as a
robot standing in the wrong place with no error at all -- so the loader is
supposed to reject them up front, and that promise needs a test.

Run:
    python feasibility_verify/test_team_config_stubbed.py
