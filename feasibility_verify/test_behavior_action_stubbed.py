"""CPU-only regression test for L2: symbolic action -> engine primitive.

Stubs OmniGibson and the engine. It pins the contract L3 depends on
(pending/success/failed/terminate_plan), the entity-id grounding, and the one
structural difference from crafter: ``execute()`` assigns a primitive and
returns immediately instead of producing a per-tick action string.
