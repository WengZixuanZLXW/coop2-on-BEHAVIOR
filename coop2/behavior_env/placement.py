"""Where to put robots and objects, built on OmniGibson's own samplers.

Hard-coded poses do not survive a scene change, and they did not really work in
the scene they were written for either: measured on Rs_int, 96% of sampled base
poses put an R1 somewhere it does not fit (see
``feasibility_verify/measure_teleport_risk.py``). So placement is derived from
the scene -- but by **calling** OmniGibson rather than re-deriving it.

Two upstream APIs do the heavy lifting:

* ``scene.get_random_point(floor, reference_point, robot)`` erodes the
  traversability map by the robot's own footprint, restricts to the connected
  component containing ``reference_point``, and samples uniformly. An earlier
  version of this module reimplemented all three by hand; it was slower (a
  whole-map room scan that was fine on a 35 m2 corridor took minutes on a
  4560 m2 hall) and needed a correctness assertion to guard coordinate
  transforms that calling the API avoids entirely.
* ``obj.states[OnTop].set_value(surface, True)`` samples a physically valid
  pose through ``sample_kinematics``. Scattering objects on bare floor cells,
  as this module used to, is neither realistic for a household benchmark nor
  reliable -- it is what forced the ``standable_fraction`` heuristics.

What genuinely has no upstream equivalent, and is therefore still here:
mutual separation between N robots (upstream placement is single-robot),
destination reservation under concurrency (see
:class:`~coop2.behavior_env.symbolic_navigation.DestinationRegistry`), and
room-scoped placement, which L1b's room-level observation depends on.

Placement runs **after** ``og.Environment`` is constructed even though
``build_multi_robot_config`` wants poses up front: the scene's maps only exist
once it is loaded. Build the config with placeholders, load, then teleport --
nothing has stepped yet, so the placeholders never matter.
