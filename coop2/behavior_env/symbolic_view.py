"""L1b: the world model rendered as text, plus the legal-action catalogue.

``target_hints`` is the single most important thing in this file. It is the
**only** way the LLM learns which ids exist and which primitives apply to them
(PORTING_PLAN 3.1). If a target is missing here the LLM cannot act on it; if a
non-target appears here the LLM will try it and burn a decision on a
precondition failure.

The vocabulary is the symbolic primitive set. Unlike
``StarterSemanticActionPrimitives`` -- where OPEN / CLOSE / TOGGLE_ON /
TOGGLE_OFF all ``raise NotImplementedError`` -- the symbolic set implements all
of them, which is why dependency constraints ("open the fridge before taking
what is inside") are expressible here at all.
