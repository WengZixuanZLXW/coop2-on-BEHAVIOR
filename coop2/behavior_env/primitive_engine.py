"""L1c — Multi-agent primitive execution engine for BEHAVIOR-1K.

One :class:`StarterSemanticActionPrimitives` controller per robot. The engine
is a **stepper, not a driver**: the caller owns the main loop, exactly as
COOP2's ``PlanningEnvWrapper`` owns it in ma_crafter.

Isomorphism with COOP2
----------------------
COOP2's barrier lives at the **plan** boundary, not the action boundary
(``PlanningEnvWrapper.step``)::

    all_ready = all(self.agents[aid].ready for aid in self.agent_names)
    if managed_agents and not all_ready:
        return self._idle_step_return({"waiting_for_agents": waiting_for})
    for agent_id in self.agent_names:          # W -> X, shared timestamp
        ...
    for agent_id in self.agent_names:          # one action from each plan
        actions[agent_id] = self.plan_executors[agent_id].step(...)

An agent only becomes un-ready when its *plan* finishes or fails
(``set_unready('plan_terminated')``); while a plan is executing the agents are
not synchronised with each other at all. This engine reproduces that:

    while not done:
        if not all_ready:                          # plan-level barrier
            yield idle_step_return(); continue     # tick() NOT called: physics frozen
        for agent_id in executing:
            if not engine.has_active(agent_id):    # previous primitive just ended
                engine.assign(agent_id, *next_primitive_of(agent_id))
        outcomes = engine.tick()                   # exactly one env.step
        for agent_id, outcome in outcomes.items():
            ...advance / fail the plan, maybe set_unready

In ma_crafter one symbolic action is ~one ``env.step``. Here one primitive is
10^3-10^4 ``env.step`` calls, so the "one action per agent per step" rule
becomes "one low-level action per agent per tick, pulled from that agent's
active primitive generator". The layering is identical, only the timescale
differs. Python generators suspend and resume for free, so freezing physics
at the barrier while a primitive is mid-flight is safe.

Why this layer has to exist
---------------------------
1. ``apply_ref`` yields **one robot's** action tensor, while
   ``Environment._pre_step`` requires a key for **every** robot (a missing key
   is a ``KeyError``, not a no-op). Non-acting robots need an explicit idle
   action every tick.
2. cuRobo's collision world is a snapshot taken at plan time
   (``update_obstacles`` walks ``robot.scene.objects`` and skips only
   ``self.robot``), and ``_execute_motion_plan`` then runs for thousands of
   ticks without re-checking. With several robots moving at once every plan is
   stale from the first tick. See :class:`MotionMode`.

Not handled here, on purpose
----------------------------
**Target arbitration.** Two agents can be assigned the same object; nothing in
BEHAVIOR-1K prevents it and this engine does not either. The loser finds out
via a ``POST_CONDITION_ERROR`` ("An unexpected object was detected in hand")
after executing a full motion. That is deliberate: contention is a
*cooperation* problem, so it belongs to the topology layer (the leader's
allocation in centralized, the proposal chain in broadcast_chain), not to a
mechanical lock down here. The engine's job is to report the failure
faithfully.

        motion_mode (str): see :class:`MotionMode`.
        obstacle_refresh_every (int): if > 0, re-run ``update_obstacles()`` on
            the active controllers every N ticks. Best-effort only: it fixes
            the world used by the *next* plan inside a primitive, it cannot
            re-route a trajectory already in flight. 0 disables.
        max_ticks_per_primitive (int or None): hard safety cap per primitive;
