"""L1: ``CooperativeBehaviorEnv`` -- the seam COOP2's upper layers plug into.

Replaces ma_crafter's ``macrafter.coop_env.CooperativeEnv``. The shape is fixed
by what L2-L6 already expect (PORTING_PLAN 5.1/5.2) and is deliberately not
negotiable: a five-tuple of dicts from ``step``, and **``info[agent_id]`` as the
real observation channel**. Agents never read ``obs`` -- in crafter it was RGB
that ``observe()`` stored and nothing consumed -- so everything the LLM can see
travels in ``info``:

===========================  ============================================
key                          consumer
===========================  ============================================
``symbolic_world_state``     L2 grounding and termination checks
``symbolic_view`` (str)      the ``## Symbolic View`` prompt section
``target_hints`` (str)       the ``## Current Reachable Targets`` section
``action_outcome`` (dict)    the L2 -> L3 success/failure contract
``task_states`` (dict)       process logging, from L1d (M6)
===========================  ============================================

One ``step()`` is one ``engine.tick()``, i.e. one ``env.step``. That is the
right granularity for the engine but the wrong one for the world model: a
primitive spans 10^2-10^3 ticks, and rebuilding the scene graph on each would
dominate the run. The model is therefore refreshed **only when a primitive
terminates** -- which is precisely when an agent returns to the reasoning stage
and has a reason to look at the world. Nobody reads it in between. Metrics follow the same split
the engine already draws: ``env_step`` counts ticks, ``decision_count`` counts
primitives, and it is ``decision_count`` that is COOP2's denominator.
