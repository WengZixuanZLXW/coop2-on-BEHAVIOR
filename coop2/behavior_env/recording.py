"""Third-person video capture driven off the engine's per-tick hook.

``MultiAgentPrimitiveEngine.on_tick`` is called once per ``env.step`` with the
tick index, which is exactly the cadence a recorder wants. The demo scripts
already use that hook for their concurrency monitor, so :func:`chain` composes
several callbacks onto the one slot.

Rendering is off in the normal headless configuration
(``gm.RENDER_VIEWER_CAMERA = False``) because the symbolic runs never need
pixels -- see PORTING_PLAN.md 4.5. :func:`enable_viewer_rendering` flips it
back on, and must be called *before* ``og.Environment`` is constructed, since
that is when the viewer camera is created.
