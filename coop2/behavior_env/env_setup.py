"""L0 — N-robot OmniGibson environment construction and startup ritual.

Everything here is configuration only; no OmniGibson source is modified.

Three things are easy to get wrong and all of them fail *silently*:

1. ``scene.include_robots`` must be **false**. ``Environment._load_robots``
   is guarded by ``if len(self.scene.robots) == 0``, so if the scene USD
   already carries robots your entire ``robots:`` list is ignored.
2. Every robot needs an explicit ``name``. The name becomes the key of the
   action dict and the observation dict; without one you get
   ``robot_<6 random letters>``.
3. Use ``model: r1``, not the deprecated ``type: R1`` (which the shipped
   configs still use and which only survives via a lowercasing warning).

    Must be called **before** any controller is constructed: ``MacroDict``
    locks a macro once it has been *read*, and a later write raises unless
    wrapped in ``macros.unlocked()`` (which we do here anyway).

    Defaults rationale:
        - ``MAX_STEPS_FOR_JOINT_MOTION`` (stock 10): the per-waypoint tracking
          budget in ``_execute_motion_plan``. With teammates perturbing the
          physics, 10 ticks routinely misses the waypoint and raises a
          spurious ``EXECUTION_ERROR``.
        - ``JOINT_POS_DIFF_THRESHOLD`` (stock 0.005): the "arrived" tolerance
          for the same check.
        - ``MAX_STEPS_FOR_SETTLING`` (stock 500): every ``_move_hand`` begins
          with a ``_settle_robot``, so this is paid many times per primitive.
          10 since 2026-09-13 (user): the symbolic robots are stable, and the
          one that is not -- a drone that starts spinning in the air -- never
          reaches the velocity threshold, so it burned the whole budget on
          every grasp. See also ``NavigableSymbolicActionPrimitives._settle_robot``,
          which caps upstream's fixed 50-tick prelude to the same 10.
        - ``DEFAULT_COLLISION_ACTIVATION_DISTANCE`` (stock 0.02): inflates the
          robot spheres against the world; extra margin for teammates.
        - ``HOLONOMIC_BASE_PRISMATIC_JOINT_LIMIT`` (stock 5.0 m): the
          planner's virtual base joint limit. Cross-room transport silently
          fails to plan beyond it. Pass a larger value for big scenes.

    Starts from the shipped ``<robot>_primitives.yaml`` because
    ``StarterSemanticActionPrimitives`` depends on that exact controller
    setup: a ``HolonomicBaseJointController`` for the base and
    ``JointController`` for trunk/arms/grippers, all with
    ``motor_type: position``, ``command_input_limits: null``,
    ``use_delta_commands: false``, ``use_impedances: false``. That is what
    makes ``robot.q_to_action(q)`` a pass-through of absolute joint targets,
    which the whole motion-execution loop assumes.

    Args:
        robot_poses: ``[(position_xyz, orientation_xyzw), ...]``, one per robot.
        robot_models: per-robot model names, for a **heterogeneous** team. One
            entry per pose; overrides ``robot_model``. Each robot's controller
            stack comes from its own ``<model>_primitives.yaml``, because that
            file is the whole reason this function exists -- an R1 template
            cloned onto a Tiago would give it joints it does not have. The
            env/scene/task skeleton still comes from one file (the first
            robot's): those sections are the same across the shipped configs
            and only the ``robots`` entry differs.
        robot_model: "R1" recommended, and used for every robot when
            ``robot_models`` is not given. **Avoid R1Pro on RTX-50 class GPUs**:
            cuRobo drops the DEFAULT embodiment at cuda capability (12,0)
            while ``update_obstacles`` / ``check_collisions`` index
            ``self.mg[DEFAULT]`` unconditionally, giving a ``KeyError``.
        scene_model: must be an ``InteractiveTraversableScene`` model --
            ``_sample_pose_near_object`` needs ``scene._seg_map``.
        load_object_categories: keep the collision world small so cuRobo
            planning stays responsive. ``None`` loads the whole house.
        objects: extra ``DatasetObject`` config dicts.
        agent_names: defaults to ``agent_0 ... agent_{n-1}``, matching COOP2's
            naming so ``SymbolicEnvWrapper``'s name_map is the identity.
        symbolic_only: set ``obs_modalities: []`` so no camera is created and
            each robot drops out of the observation space entirely
            (``Environment`` gates robot obs on ``maxdim(...) > 0``).
