"""A cuRobo-free ``NAVIGATE_TO`` for the symbolic primitive set.

``SymbolicSemanticActionPrimitiveSet.NAVIGATE_TO`` is in the enum and mapped to
a handler, but it cannot execute as shipped. Two independent defects on the
same path:

1. ``SymbolicSemanticActionPrimitives`` overrides only ``_navigate_to_pose``
   (making it a pure teleport). ``_navigate_to_obj`` and
   ``_sample_pose_near_object`` are inherited from
   ``StarterSemanticActionPrimitives``, and the sampler opens with
   ``self._motion_generator.update_obstacles()`` then validates candidates with
   cuRobo IK + collision checks. The symbolic constructor passes
   ``skip_curobo_initilization=True``, so ``self._motion_generator is None``
   and the call raises ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute
   'update_obstacles'``.
2. Even with a motion generator present, ``_navigate_to_obj`` calls
   ``self._navigate_to_pose(pose, skip_obstacle_update=...)`` while the
   symbolic override is declared ``_navigate_to_pose(self, pose_2d)`` -- no
   such keyword -- so it would raise ``TypeError``.

So NAVIGATE_TO is unusable in the symbolic set exactly the way OPEN / CLOSE /
TOGGLE_ON / TOGGLE_OFF are unusable in the physical set (those raise
``NotImplementedError``).

This module supplies the missing piece: sample a base pose around the target,
keep it in the same room, and teleport there. No cuRobo, no collision check,
no reachability check -- which is consistent with the rest of the symbolic set,
where ``_grasp`` teleports the object to the end-effector at any distance and
``_navigate_to_pose`` teleports the base with no collision checking either.

Why bother navigating at all when symbolic grasping ignores distance? Because
COOP2's **spatial** constraint is defined on where the agents are: "how many
agents are near the task". Without a working NAVIGATE_TO there is no way for a
symbolic-mode agent to satisfy it, and the spatial metric degenerates.

    Checking separation against other robots' current positions is not enough
    under concurrency, and the failure is a textbook time-of-check/time-of-use
    race. All N agents are assigned NAVIGATE_TO on the same tick; each samples
    its destination on its generator's first ``next()``, while every other robot
    is still standing at its start pose metres away. Every check passes. Then
    all of them teleport next to the same object and interpenetrate -- measured
    at 0.64 m apart against a 1.24 m requirement, which was enough for one
    robot's assisted grasp to latch onto **another robot** (``holding=agent_0``).

    So agents reserve the pose they are about to occupy, and everyone else's
    sampler avoids reservations as well as bodies.

    Reservations are overwritten, never explicitly released: a reservation means
    "this agent intends to be here", which stays true until it decides to go
    somewhere else, and once the robot has actually arrived the reservation and
    its body coincide. That makes a dropped or aborted primitive self-correcting

class NavigableSymbolicActionPrimitives(SymbolicSemanticActionPrimitives):
    """Symbolic primitives whose ``NAVIGATE_TO`` actually runs.

    Drop-in replacement for :class:`SymbolicSemanticActionPrimitives`; only the
    two broken navigation methods are overridden.

    Upstream samples the same 0-1.5 m annulus we do, but then runs every
    candidate through ``_validate_poses`` -- cuRobo IK plus a collision query --
    and returns only one that passes. That stage is what keeps the robot out of
    walls, not the distance range. Dropping cuRobo therefore means replacing it,
    and measurement says the replacement has to be *three* checks, because each
    covers a different obstacle class:

    * ``reach``/``clearance`` -- the target itself. cuRobo does not catch this:
      an apple is 5 cm on the floor and the base clears it, so ``check_collisions``
      called every pose from 0.05 m out collision-free (8/8). Symbolic grasp then
      teleports the object into a robot standing on top of it and the settle
      shakes it loose.
    * ``require_traversable`` -- static geometry. The scene's baked trav map,
      eroded by the robot's own radius, is what cuRobo's collision query buys us,
      for free and on the CPU.
    * ``robot_separation`` -- teammates. Static maps do not contain them. Without
      this, two robots teleport into the same spot, PhysX shoves them apart, and
      the physical assisted grasp latches onto the other *robot*.

    Args:
        env, robot: as the base class.
        reach: metres of usable annulus *beyond* the target's clearance radius.
            The sampling range is ``[clearance(obj), clearance(obj) + reach]``,
            so it widens automatically for a table and stays tight for an apple.
            A fixed range cannot do this: for a large object a 1.5 m upper bound
            is inside the object.

            This also sets the **manipulation gate**, because
            ``interaction_radius_for`` is this annulus's upper bound plus a
            margin -- deliberately, so that a pose ``navigate_to`` produced can
            never be rejected as ``TOO_FAR``, which would loop forever. So
            ``reach`` is the one number that decides how far away an agent may
            grasp or place: the slack works out to
            ``reach + 0.35 + clearance_margin`` of clear floor between the
            robot's edge and the object's, the same for every object.

            Was 1.5 (1.9 m of clear floor -- twice R1's arm), then 0.8 (1.2 m).
            **Now 0.6**, which with the manipulation guard gives a 0.70 m gap.
            Measured before changing: shrinking the annulus does not cost standing
            poses, it gains them, because the outer ring of a wide annulus mostly
            falls outside the room or on non-traversable floor (coffee table
            acceptance 48.8 % at 1.5, 60.0 % at 0.6; apples 37.7 %/25.2 % ->
            38.2 %/35.2 %). Below 0.6 the apples do start losing poses, which is
            why this is the floor.
        clearance_margin: slack added to (target half-diagonal + robot radius).
        robot_radius: circumscribed radius. ``None`` derives it from
            ``reset_joint_pos_aabb_extent``, which is what the trav map's own
            erosion uses.
        robot_separation: minimum centre-to-centre distance to another robot.
            ``None`` means ``2 * robot_radius`` -- just-touching. Nothing more is
            needed: symbolic navigation teleports, so there is no path to keep
            clear, only bodies to keep from overlapping.
        require_traversable: reject poses where the eroded trav map says the
            robot does not fit. Silently inert on a scene with no trav map.
        destinations: shared :class:`DestinationRegistry`. Without one,
            separation is checked only against where robots currently stand,
            which under concurrency is where they were *before* they all
            teleported to the same place.
        sampling_attempts: how many candidates to try before giving up.
        require_same_room: reject candidates outside the target's room. Set
            False for scenes without a segmentation map (a plain ``Scene``
            rather than an ``InteractiveTraversableScene``).
        distance_range: absolute ``(lo, hi)`` override. When given it replaces
            the object-relative range entirely -- kept for the stubbed tests and
            for reproducing the old behaviour.
