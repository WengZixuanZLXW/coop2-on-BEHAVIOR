"""Who is in the scene, what kind of robot each one is, and who they work with.

Reads one JSON file. Everything an experiment needs to know about the *team* --
robot models, where each robot starts, and how robots are grouped -- lives there
rather than in CLI flags, because the three are not independent: a team is a set
of named robots, and a name only means something once that robot has a model and
a place to stand.

Shape::

    {
      "robots": [
        {"name": "agent_0", "model": "R1",    "position": [-9.1, -1.8], "team": "alpha"},
        {"name": "agent_1", "model": "Tiago", "room": "living_room_0",  "team": "alpha"},
        {"name": "agent_2", "model": "R1",    "room": "kitchen_0",      "team": "bravo"}
      ]
    }

``position`` and ``room`` are two ways to say where a robot starts and exactly
one of them is required per robot:

* ``position`` is exact -- ``[x, y]`` or ``[x, y, z]``, world coordinates. Use it
  to reproduce a layout precisely, or to put a robot somewhere the room-scoped
  sampler would never choose.
* ``room`` is a room *instance* ("living_room_0", not "living_room"): the robot
  is placed by the usual sampler inside that room, mutually separated from
  everyone else. Use it when the exact spot does not matter.

Teams may be given per robot (``"team": "alpha"``) or as an explicit map::

      "teams": {"alpha": ["agent_0", "agent_1"], "bravo": ["agent_2"]}

Both forms are accepted and they must agree if both are present. A robot with no
team at all lands in a team of its own, which is what makes the single-agent and
one-LLM-per-robot topologies a special case of the team topology rather than a
separate code path.

A robot that does not ship with BEHAVIOR is declared the same way, plus the
config that describes it::

      {"name": "agent_3", "model": "MyRobot", "room": "kitchen_0",
       "config": "/path/to/myrobot_primitives.yaml"}

That file needs one thing: a ``robots[0]`` entry with the controller stack the
symbolic primitives require (HolonomicBaseJointController for the base,
JointControllers for trunk/arms/grippers, all absolute position mode). Nothing
else in coop2 asks what kind of robot it is driving. Equivalently, call
:func:`register_robot_model` once at import time and then name the model as
usual.

Validation is strict and up front on purpose. Every field here ends up either in
an OmniGibson robot config or in a placement call, and both of those fail late
and confusingly: a bad model name surfaces as a missing YAML halfway through
scene load, and a bad room name surfaces as a robot standing in the wrong place
with no error at all.

    Keeps the CLI working without a second code path: ``--agents 9`` is nine R1s
    sampled in the task room. ``team_size`` groups them into teams of that size
    (the remainder forms a smaller last team); without it every robot is its own
    team, which is the one-LLM-per-robot behaviour.
