"""Placeholder for ma_crafter's grid A* navigation, which is not ported.

The port drops this module entirely: crafter navigates a discrete grid,
while here NAVIGATE_TO is a primitive -- a cuRobo motion plan in the physical
set, a filtered teleport in the symbolic one
(:mod:`coop2.behavior_env.symbolic_navigation`). ``action.py`` still imports
these three names at module scope, so they exist and fail loudly if called.

They should disappear when L2 is rewritten in M5, along with the callers.
