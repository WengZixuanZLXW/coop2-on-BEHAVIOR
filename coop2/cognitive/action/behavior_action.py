"""L2 for BEHAVIOR-1K: symbolic action -> engine primitive.

Replaces ma_crafter's crafter controllers. The architecture is kept --
``ActionRecord``, ``SymbolicActionStatus`` and the
pending/success/failed/terminate_plan contract of
``check_termination_condition`` are imported from :mod:`.action` unchanged,
because L3 is built on them and the whole point of the port is to leave the
upper layers alone.

What changes is the shape of a "primitive". Crafter's executor returns one
action **string per environment step** (``"move_left"``, ``"do"``): symbolic
actions are one or a few ticks. Here a primitive is a generator that runs for
10^2-10^3 ticks inside :class:`MultiAgentPrimitiveEngine`, and the caller owns
the loop. So ``execute()`` does not return a per-tick action -- it *assigns*
the primitive and returns its name, and ``check_termination_condition``
consumes the outcome the engine reports when the primitive finally terminates.

The other job of this layer is **grounding**: the LLM speaks in the type-local
ids L1b hands it (``apple#1``), while the engine addresses objects by their
scene name (``apple_agveuv_0``). Translating here, rather than letting either
side see the other's names, is what keeps prompts readable and the engine
unaware that an LLM exists.
